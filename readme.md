##About

This project is a game designed for young people with ASD to practice recognising emotions. A user is shown a face and asked to identify the emotion it's displaying. Their choice is then compared to that made by the Microsoft Facial Emotion API. The game is inspired by emotion recognition games that are currently used with children with ASD in schools. However, we feel the app would be an improvement on several fronts:
* The image set can potentially be far larger, meaning users aren't simply memorising the correct answer for individual faces on repeated play.
* Data tracking would allow users to track their personal results, as well as the overall effectiveness of the game to be measured.
* By comparing the user's results to an API rather than that of an authority figure like a teacher, we hope to instill more respect for the user's choices.


##Four Day Sprint
During the four day sprint we were able to create a semi-functioning prototype of Face It. The prototype successfully simulated a typical user journey we envisioned for the full app, taking the user from entering user data, through gameplay, and to their results.

##Two Week Sprint
In a two week sprint, our priorities would be:

* Implementing a user account system, allowing users' results to be stored between game rounds.
* Using D3 to display those results as dynamic graphs.
* Creating characterisation for the logo character and integrating it throughout the app.
* Releasing the game as a mobile app.

##Four Week Sprint
In a four week sprint, we would go on to:

* Significantly widen the image set.
* Create a true leveling system, with the game increasing in difficulty as the user improves.
* Include other users' choices alongside the API's in the results comparison graphs.

##Test Plan

We would advise that the prototype is made available to as large a variety of test users as is feasible, as our aim is for the app to be appealing and appropriate for a wide user group â€“ young people aged 10-15, across the autistic spectrum. In particular, we'll be looking for user's feedback on:
* The app's colour scheme and animation
* The balance between text and images in the app (could we make more use of icons and emojis?)
