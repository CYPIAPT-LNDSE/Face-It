##About
This project uses the Microsoft Facial Emotion API in order to create a game based on recognising the emotions present in photos. It works with the API in order to minimise human influence on the results. It is inspired by Facial Emotion games that are currently used in schools.


##Four Day Sprint
During the four day sprint, under the guidance of @daymos, we were able to create a prototype of Face It. The prototype featured a login screen, a welcome screen, a loading page, and a 5 pictured game play, whereby the user could select the emotion they deemed best reflected the image on display. Following this game play, a screen with the results from the round, and a lifetime results page was created, albeit featuring dummy data. This particular page was a mock-up design, and is the aim for completion during the two week sprint. 

##Two Week Sprint
Following the four day sprint, the prototype of the Face It application was developed. In the two week sprint, the aim would be to increase functionality (such as with the level bar), to create multiple levels, and - using D3 - create actual data about the lifetime of the game play in comparison with the API. This data would be used for two reasons - by the clinition for data analysis, but also for the user to acknowledge their development.

##Test Plan
We would advise that multiple users - of different ages - use the prototype in order to check its' functionality, and ease of use. Further, monitoring colour response, as well as response to the emotion and emoticon (e.g. happiness with the smiling emoji), would help with designing the application.
